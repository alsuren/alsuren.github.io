title: Paper Cuts
---

There is a phrase "death by a thousand paper-cuts". This would be the most
painful way to die. In real life, paper cuts are anything that cause you to lose
your flow. They slow you down and suck the joy out of everyday activities.

I have been making a conscious effort to address these things recently. I
thought it might be nice to write down a few of them. Mostly as a
self-congratulatory exercise. This will probably read like a
[brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/), but with less of a
purpose.

Let's have a look then, shall we?

**Problem:** Madison Bike Panniers kept clipping my heels, on my new bike.

**Solution:** Buy new panniers. I highly recommend the Madison ones though:
they're super-cheap and fold small. They also daisy-chain, so you can fit 4 of
them on a single rack. They were also fine on my old dutch bike. My new bike is
just a bit sportier, and I couldn't find any rear racks that were as good as the
one built into my old dutch bike.

**Problem:** Back gate lock kept sticking because the wood got warped in the
rain.

**Solution:** Find the Chisel and chisel out 5 times as much wood as I did last
time (finding the chisel took the most time on this one - multiple weeks).

**Problem:** A bunch of little
[DX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience#Developer_experience)
paper-cuts at my new job.

**Solution:** I've started allowing myself one DX change for every 2 user-facing
changes that I make. I feel like this is a reasonable balance, because DX
changes tend to be pretty tiny.
