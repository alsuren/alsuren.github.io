title: (Sunday) - Found https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-repos

All of my previous analysis was on repos that got as far as being published on crates.io. This excludes repos from beginner rust users and repos that aren't libraries. After downloading all of the configs pointed to by that repo, and re-running the analysis, I added a comment to https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/218 with my findings.
